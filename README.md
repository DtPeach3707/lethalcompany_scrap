# lethalcompany_scrap
The goal here is to calculate the average scrap from every moon in the latest version of lethal company, currently version 50.

To use the program, you can edit both the moon selected by editing the variable **moon_to_use** and the number of runs for the program to take by editing the variable **number_of_runs**.

The first line of the output is the average scrap value. The second line is the time in seconds it took for the program to run.

- March: 549
- Adamance: 669
- Rend: 1224
- Dine: 1255

- *Should be noted that these have been rounded

## List of Things to Add
- Add Embrion for fun
- Add more detail to output to make it more clear
- Maybe add GUI to make use easier
- Find automated way to acquire data to avoid manual entry
